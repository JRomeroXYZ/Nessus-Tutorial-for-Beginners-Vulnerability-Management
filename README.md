Lab Overview:

In this vulnerability management lab, the focus is on strengthening the understanding of the vulnerability management processes. Vulnerability management is the continuous process of assessing assets, identifying vulnerabilities, remedying them to an acceptable risk level, and repeating the cycle to maintain a low or acceptable level of risk within an organization's security framework. The key objectives include the installation of Nessus Essentials and VMware Workstation Player, followed by the setup of a Windows 10 virtual machine. Within this VM, aged and deprecated software will intentionally be installed to simulate a potentially vulnerable environment.

Subsequently, vulnerability scans will be conducted on the virtual machine using Nessus. These scans aim to reveal existing vulnerabilities within the system, offering valuable insights into the security posture of the environment. Following the identification of these vulnerabilities, the next step involves remediating the vulnerabilities. This practical remediation process provides a unique opportunity to observe the effects of addressing security flaws and to gain a deeper understanding of the practical aspects of enhancing system security.

Technologies Used:

1.	Nessus Essentials - Nessus Essentials is a widely used vulnerability scanner and assessment tool that helps identify security weaknesses in computer systems, networks, and applications.
2.	VMware Workstation Player - VMware Workstation Player is a virtualization software that enables users to create and run virtual machines on their desktop computers, making it easier to test and manage different operating systems and software configurations.
3.	Windows 10 ISO Virtual Machine - A Windows 10 virtual machine is a virtualized instance of the Windows 10 operating system, allowing users to run Windows 10 on their computers without the need for a separate physical system.
4.	Deprecated Firefox (3.6.12) - Deprecated Firefox refers to an older or no longer supported version of the Firefox web browser, which may not receive security updates or feature enhancements, making it potentially vulnerable to security risks.
